# Graph Visualization Libraries Comparison in Python

## Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate and compare various interactive graph visualization libraries available in Python. It provides insights into the features, performance, and ease of use of each library, helping developers choose the right tool for their specific needs.

## Libraries Evaluated

- NetworkX
- Matplotlib (for basic graph visualization)
- Ipysigma
- Pyvis
- [we will cover more liberaries in future]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

## Usage

This project contains examples and evaluations for each graph visualization library covered. To get started with the examples, follow these steps:

1. **Activate the Poetry Environment**: Ensure you've activated the project's virtual environment created by Poetry.

    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

2. **Run the Examples**: Within each library's directory, you'll find Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks that you can run to see the library in action.

    - For Python scripts:

        ```bash
        python example_script.py
        ```

    - For Jupyter notebooks, start the Jupyter notebook server (if you haven't installed Jupyter, you can do so via Poetry by adding it to the project's dependencies):

        ```bash
        poetry run jupyter lab
        ```

        Then, navigate to the notebook in your browser and run the cells.

Feel free to explore the examples, modify them, and use them as a basis for your own graph visualization projects.
